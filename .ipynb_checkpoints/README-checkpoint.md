# 🧠 Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection (PySpark)

This project analyzes a dataset of credit card transactions using PySpark to uncover fraud patterns and generate meaningful insights through data transformation and visualization.

## 📂 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Credit Card Transactions](#)
- Format: Nested JSON with embedded personal details and timestamps
- Size: ~160K records, real-world-like structure

## ⚙️ Data Transformation Overview

### 🔒 Handling PII
- `cc_num`: Masked using SHA-256 hashing
- `person_name`: Split into `first` and `last` using regex, discarding noisy parts
- `street`: Removed from final output to reduce re-identification risk

### 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Parsed and flattened nested JSON fields (`personal_detail`, `address`)
- Converted dirty string types (e.g. `amt`) into floats
- Normalized timestamps (`trans_date_trans_time`, `merch_eff_time`, `merch_last_update_time`) to UTC+8 in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSSSSS Z` format
- Removed nulls and handled inconsistent naming formats
